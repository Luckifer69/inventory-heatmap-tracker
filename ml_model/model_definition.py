    You can customize various parameters of the Prophet model here to fine-tune
    its behavior based on the characteristics of your sales data.

def define_arima_model_placeholder():

    This function serves as a conceptual placeholder for defining an ARIMA model.
    In practice, when using `pmdarima.auto_arima`, the model selection (defining
    the order p,d,q and seasonal P,D,Q,s) happens during the fitting process itself.
    Therefore, you typically don't "define" an empty ARIMA model with fixed parameters
    before training it with `auto_arima`.

    If you were to use `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA` with pre-determined orders,
    you would define it here. For `pmdarima.auto_arima`, the definition is implicitly
    part of the training (model_training.py).

    This placeholder function returns a simple object to illustrate the concept.
